What does it do?

A simple addon for blender to map the standard G, R, S hotkeys to the view tools, so you don't have to use the snapping hotkeys X, Y, Z. 

Instructions:
1. Download the .zip file using the green button "Code" and then the drop menu button "download zip"
2. Extract the zip.
3. In blender, go to Preferecens>Addons>Install and navigate to your extracted lazyviewport.py 

Once installed, use G, R, S with the user friendly viewport gizmo tools :) 

Yay for lazyness!
